# Wildfires

Welcome to Wildfires telegram Bot!

This is a project based on the BERNARD Framework to guess the start of a Wildfire. In here we use NASA satellite images and a Bisection Algorithm in order to detect the occurrence of wildfires at a specific location.

You can find the documentation about the technology used in the next links:
 - [BERNARD's documentation](https://github.com/BernardFW/bernard).
 - [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and [NASA python Wrapper](https://github.com/brendanv/nasa-api)
 - [Telegram Bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
